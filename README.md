## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to create svg files and add them to the webpage.

### Continued development

I would like to do this project using react or a similar framework as it became a bit tricky manipulating dom elements and there was some duplication.

### Useful resources

- [https://codepen.io/] - This helped me create the mock tooltip svg and experiment with its sizing and content.
